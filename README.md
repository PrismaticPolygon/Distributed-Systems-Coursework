# Distributed Systems Coursework

This is my submission for the Distributed Systems coursework of the Networks and Systems module at Durham University, 2019.

## Running

To run the system, use `main.bat`, located in the base repository. By default, this launches 5 terminal windows - the 
Pyro name server, 1 frontend (FE), and 3 replicas (RM). The original terminal window serves as the client. By entering
commands as the client, the propagation of requests and queries can be traced through the FE and the RMs.
